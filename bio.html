        <p><b>Behaviour</b></p>
        <p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>Behavior All pocket gophers create a network of tunnel systems that provide protection and a means of collecting food.</li>
                <li> They are larder hoarders, and their cheek pouches are used for transporting food back to their burrows. Gophers can collect large hoards. </li>
                <li> Unlike ground squirrels, gophers do not live in large communities and seldom find themselves above ground. The entrances can be identified by small piles of loose soil covering the opening.</li>
                    <li> Their burrows can be found in many areas where the soil is softer and easily tunneled. They often appear in vegetable gardens, lawns, or farms, as gophers like moist soil (see Soil biomantle). This has led to their frequent treatment as pests. Gophers eat plant roots, shrubs, and other vegetables such as carrots, lettuce, radishes, and any other vegetables with juice. Some species are considered agricultural pests.</li>
